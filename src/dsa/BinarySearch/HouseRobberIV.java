//Question ->There are several consecutive houses along a street, each of which has some money inside. There is also a robber, who wants to steal money from the homes, but he refuses to steal from adjacent homes.
//The capability of the robber is the maximum amount of money he steals from one house of all the houses he robbed.
//You are given an integer array nums representing how much money is stashed in each house. More formally, the ith house from the left has nums[i] dollars.
//You are also given an integer k, representing the minimum number of houses the robber will steal from. It is always possible to steal at least k houses.
//Return the minimum capability of the robber out of all the possible ways to steal at least k houses.
